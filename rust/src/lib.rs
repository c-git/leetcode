// Add new file as a module to make it run

// TODO Add instructions on how to setup code to run and update readme
// Interim note: Currently using cargo leet https://github.com/rust-practice/cargo-leet to generate the
// stubs for new problems. Will update readme and notes here after cargo leet stabilizes a bit. Feel free
// to reach out if you want to make use of my setup before I document it. (Opening an issue on github is a
// fine way to get in touch)
